# Quantification-of-grass-severing-bites

## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB code used for the article "Quantification of grass-severing bites performed by grazing cattle using halter-mounted accelerometers and machine learning". The code is organized into two phases, each contained in separate folders:

- `Phase1_Code`: Contains MATLAB code and `.mat` files for the first phase of the project - behavior classification.
- `Phase2_Code`: Contains MATLAB code and `.mat` files for the second phase of the project - bite quantification.

The input and output data used during the process are stored on a Mega.nz account. You can access the data through the following link:

[[https://mega.nz/C!OBVVFQzL](https://mega.nz/C!OBVVFQzL)](https://mega.nz/folder/iUNWkAhK#_ooP6MLrmLeaCJFdFRMtXg)

If the data is moved elsewhere, the link will be updated in this README.
